                <h3>Rowing</h3>
                <p>I started rowing in the summer of 2023, my summer before 8th grade. I tried the sport for the fiirst time in middleschool, I found it because my brother had joined the highschool team that year so I decided to try rowing, a sport I had never really heard of before. I ended up loving the sport and my freshman year of highschool I started competitivly rowing, I've been competitvly rowing for about 5 months and have already travelled to and competed in the Milwaukee River Challenge Regatta in Millwaukee on the Milwaukee river and the second biggest fall season regatta The Haed of The Hooch Regatta in Chattanooga, Tennesse on the Tennesse River. My boat won first place in the girls youth novice catagory of the Head of the Hooch we won by 18 seconds, finishing the 4.5km in 16:12. My boat placed 19th in the Milwaukee river challenge in the women's jr catagory which included all varsity entries and novice entries, we finishing the 5k in 20:38 with a collision. My 2k time is currently 8:16 and I have been working a lot on the ergs lately to improve my time. </p>
