                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>I enjoy painting and cooking, I also have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I have been painting since 4th grade during the pandemic when I would watch videos of people doing pour painting on my moms phone, that christmas I asked for the supplies to do it myself. I was obsessed with pour painting in my backyard for the entirity of the pandemic before I began to try other forms of abstract painting and even a little bit of realistic paint too. I chose art as my 8th grade elective and found even more success and interest in painting, learning different techniques and how to better paint realistically. I earned my black belt right before 8th grade I was in Tae Kwon Do for 3.5 years, I quit because I lost my passion and found the instructor to be very rude, sensitive, favoring, and selfish. I enjoy cooking very much because i love to try new foods and experiament with differnt flavors, cooking I get to make the food I want in the way I want exactly to my taste. When I cook I also have a lot of crtics, having 3 siblings comes in handy especially when what I cooked didn't exactly cater to the taste I wanted and I don't want to eat it I know that one of my siblings will.</p>
