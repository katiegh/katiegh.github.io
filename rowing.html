                    <h3>Rowing</h3>
                    <p>I started rowing in my summer before 8th grade, my brother joined the highschool team the year before and really enjoyed it so I decided to try it out. I started with a middle school summer program and did the rest of the middle school season, it was very uncompetitve. I reached highschool and joined the novice team a much more competitive team, finding a new love for th esport participating my first big name regatta (The Milwaukee River Challenge) in which we placed 19th with a time of 20:48. I then competed in the head of the hooch later that year, the second biggest fall regatta in the U.S. my boat won the novice catagory by 18 seconds we completed the 4.5k in 16:12. I have only ever rowed in sweeped eights, I am stronger on starboard, but I am capable of rowing on both sides, my current 2k is 8:16, I have rowed in almost every seat in the boat but I have spent the most time in stern pair.</p>
