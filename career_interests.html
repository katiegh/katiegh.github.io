                    <p>I have always greatly enjoyed math class more than any other class.I remember in fifth grade when math just clicked for me and I realized that it wasn't like that for everyone else but didn't exactly understand how other people in class did not understand the concepts as easily I did. In school any time we had an engineering based project or a project that involoved building something were my favorite and I greatly looked forward to them, always completing the project with joy and my all. I have had all As and Bs in math and science for the entiry I have been in school and hope to pursue an engineering career hopefully an aerospace engineer for a place like NASA one day.</p>
