                    <h3>Elementary</h3>
                    <p>I went to a small catholic shool in Old Irving Park called St. Viator for 10 years, grades pre-K 3 to 7th grade. I was a very active member of this schools community, partcipating in the National Junior Honor Society, Student council commitee, Science Olympiad, intramural sports, travel basketball and volleyball, and many more. I was always a very active part of that school community and easily got all As through out my entire time at that school. St. Viator was on a seven point grading scale, meaning in order to achieve an A I would need a 93%. Despite the higher grading scale I still found school extremely easy and struggled to understand how people were sturggling. i decided to transfer out of that schol for 8th grade because I was by no means being challenged in any subject and was not confident in the schools skills to prepare me to test into a selective enrollment school and succeed in it, due to majority of the students choosing to go to catholic highschools.</p>

                    <h3>Second Elementary</h3>
                    <p>For my eighth garde year I decided to transfer to Coonley elementary school a CPS school, where I got in to the gifted program. I transfered to this school for only one year, because I was extremely unconfident in St.Viator's ability to prepare me for the highschool test let alone highschool itself. Transfering to coonley ended up being the best descion of my life, I expanded my social skills making new friends after having the same ones for ten years, and I was finally challenged academically. All though transfering to a new school many more people meant I was no longer the smartest and was not graded so lightly any more I was able to continue my path down the A honor roll. I ended my first semester with all As and a B and my second semester with all As. Going to this school prepared my for highschool immensely as it challenged me far more than I had ever been before and greatly prepared me to take the actually highschool test leading me to get into my dream highschool.</p>

                    <h3>Highschool</h3>
                    <p>I attend Lane Tech College Prep currently, I am  freshman and recently completed my first semester ending with a weighted GPA of 4.8 and an unweighted GPA of 3.8. I take all honors classes, except for PE, and I am taking a one AP class. I am greatly enjoying Lane Tech, I have settled into the change academically and I'm now thriving, my grades are up because I had a strong start into my second semester of freshman year. I found many good friends in lunch and all of my classes. Transitioning into one of the biggest highschools in my state has been actually perfect for me, because I found my people, there are classes that I love and the teachers are passionate and amazing. The other students at my school are very good, because it being a seclective enrollemnt school majority of the kids there want to learn and thrive causing teacher tto want to work there since the students want to learn</p>
